# Design Pattern
> Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that arise in software design. They represent best practices for designing and structuring code to solve specific recurring issues. Design patterns are not code templates or finished designs but rather guidelines that help developers tackle certain types of problems in a flexible and efficient way.

* **Creational Patterns**:
   These patterns deal with the process of object creation, providing mechanisms for creating instances of objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
        Examples: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype.

* **Structural Patterns**:
        Structural patterns are concerned with the composition of classes or objects and form larger structures.
        Examples: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy.

* **Behavioral Patterns**:
        Behavioral patterns define the ways in which objects interact, communicate, and collaborate with each other.
        Examples: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor.
